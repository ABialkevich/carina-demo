Carina is a Java-based framework that uses the Selenium WebDriver API for testing Web UI interfaces. These days, integration testing is not limited by one component validation, but engages multiple modules from both the front-end and back-end of applications, which is why Carina also provides instruments for testing REST and SoapUI web services, along with DB validations. Carina makes it possible to implement robust test scenarios that cover different aspects of application functionality. The following instruments are included in the Carina package:
* Selenium WebDriver
* Rest-Assured framework
* SoapUI instruments
* MyBatis ORM framework
